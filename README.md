# Blinkit_Analysis
I developed a Blinkit Analysis dashboard in Power BI to evaluate sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The project tracks KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Item Count, and Ratings, with visualizations by fat content, item type, outlet size, location, and outlet type for actionable insights.
